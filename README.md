# Project 6: Password Complexity & Strength Evaluation

## üìå Overview
This mini-project focuses on understanding how password complexity impacts security. I created multiple passwords with varying lengths, character sets, and patterns, tested them using a password strength checker, and analyzed the results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

1. **Created Multiple Passwords**
   - Generated a list of passwords ranging from simple (e.g., `password123`) to complex (e.g., `W!7$hT9#Qp*2`).

2. **Used Character Variations**
   - Included:
     - Lowercase letters
     - Uppercase letters
     - Numbers
     - Special symbols
     - Different lengths (8‚Äì20+ characters)

3. **Tested Passwords**
   - Ran each password through reputable password strength checkers such as:
     - [HowSecureIsMyPassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net)
     - [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com)

4. **Recorded Scores & Feedback**
   - Noted estimated crack times, strength levels (Weak, Medium, Strong), and recommendations.

5. **Identified Best Practices**
   - Learned which factors significantly increase strength (length, randomness, mixing character types).

6. **Key Tips Learned**
   - Longer is stronger ‚Äî every extra character adds exponential difficulty for attackers.
   - Avoid dictionary words, common phrases, and predictable substitutions.
   - Use a combination of symbols, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
   - Consider using passphrases with random unrelated words.

7. **Researched Common Attacks**
   - **Brute Force:** Systematically tries every possible combination.
   - **Dictionary Attack:** Uses lists of common passwords or words.

8. **Summary**
   - Password complexity dramatically affects resistance to attacks.
   - Weak passwords can be cracked in seconds.
   - Strong, unique passwords make brute-force or dictionary attacks impractical.

## üìä Key Takeaways

- Never reuse passwords across sites.
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong, random passwords.
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) wherever possible for extra security.
